suppression, thresholds.

timeperiod in 2 fields ,logged and expires then can select based on now being between logged and expired.
then if count > allowed can enable suppress/threshold.

may place in event??? and /or alert??

select * from ALERT join event on event.alert_uuid = uuid where alert_state <1  AND logged < now - 30 AND now < expired

need to also use alert_correllation_id and check against passed in param from new alert.

Maybe treat these like rules ... checking all rather than fail on first.

suppress count and or count/seconds
Threshold count/seconds
AlertAfter second message in regex not seen (or in seconds)

need timer task to clear alerts/events after 24 hours.
